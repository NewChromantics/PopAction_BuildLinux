The x86_64 build runs on a Github hosted runner so there needs to be a setup part to download the needed files eg. libx264.

The architecture for nvidia is stated in reference to an if statement in the Linux Makefile.

The files that need to be returned can be passed in as parameters in the action.yml at a later stage.
